## Introduction

GeoGenIE (Geographic-Genetic Inference Engine) is a comprehensive software tool designed to predict geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) from genetic SNP data. GeoGenIE utilizes deep learning models and offers several advanced features such as automated parameter tuning with Optuna [1], outlier detection to remove individuals that do not conform to expected geographic and genetic patterns (e.g., isolation by distance) [3], handling of imbalanced sampling using a custom oversampling algorithm adapted from SMOTE [2], and weighting the loss function by inverse sampling densities. The software is user-friendly and provides extensive visualizations and metrics for evaluating predictions, making it a robust and accurate solution for geographic-genetic inference.

## Installation

To install GeoGenIE, it is recommended to use a virtual environment or conda environment. From the root project directory, enter the following command while in the root project directory.

```bash
pip install GeoGenIE
```

## Usage

### Running GeoGenIE

GeoGenIE can be run with individual command-line arguments, but using a YAML config file is recommended. See `config_files/config.yaml` for an example YAML file. Assuming GeoGenIE is installed in your environment, you can run it like this:

```bash
geogenie --config config_files/config.yaml
```

### Command-line Options

You can see all the command-line options by running the help flag:

```bash
geogenie -h
```

**Note:** If you don't want to use the configuration file, you can specify each argument individually on the command line. For example:

```bash
geogenie --output_dir "my_analysis" --prefix "my_prefix" <other arguments>
```

### Configuration File

You can set all the options for input files, model parameters, etc., in the `config_files/config.yaml` file. Using a configuration file allows tracking of parameters across multiple runs and ensures better reproducibility.

- Python `None` values are represented by `null` (without quotes).
- Python `True` values are represented by `true` (all lowercase, no quotes).
- Python `False` values are represented by `false` (all lowercase, no quotes).

You can also leave comments with `# my_comment`. The arguments can be in any order in the `config_files/config.yaml` file.

### Running the Software

```bash
geogenie --config config_files/config.yaml
```

A dataset to test the software can be found in the following Open Science Framework repository: https://osf.io/jsqz9 (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/JSQZ9)
